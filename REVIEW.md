# Review guidance for RESMP-DEV/rust_sindexer

Kilo reads this file from the pull request base branch. Apply these repository-owned rules to the changed behavior and its reachable callers; do not treat this file as permission to weaken platform safety or read-only review constraints.

## What matters in this repository

- Review RESMP-DEV/rust_sindexer as the source of truth for the zero-configuration hybrid code-indexing MCP server and its incremental-index contract.
- Keep changes scoped. Flag broad refactors when a smaller explicit fix would preserve behavior and make risk easier to verify.
- Preserve collection isolation by canonical repository root plus backend/model/dimension identity; never allow one checkout to reuse or overwrite another repository's vectors.
- update_index must remain incremental and must refuse an implicit initial/full rebuild when the compatible manifest or collection is missing. Full rebuilds stay explicit.
- Changes to the MCP surface need a real initialize, tools/list, and representative read-only tool call; a successful Cargo build alone is not protocol proof.
- Preserve CLI, protocol, file-format, and configuration compatibility unless the change explicitly migrates every supported caller. Validate cancellation, cleanup, and partial-failure behavior.
- Audit unsafe code, FFI, subprocess, filesystem, network, and concurrency boundaries for ownership, lifetime, race, deadlock, injection, traversal, and resource-leak defects.
- Do not accept configuration or documentation as proof that a runtime path is active; require a live probe of the implemented interface when practical.
- For Rust changes, scrutinize unsafe blocks, Send/Sync assumptions, async cancellation, panic surfaces, error context, feature gates, and serialization/CLI compatibility.
- Use focused unit or integration tests plus the repository's formatting, lint, and test commands; compile success is not enough for runtime or concurrency changes.

## Severity calibration

- **Critical:** credible data loss or corruption, privilege or tenant-boundary bypass, credential exposure, remote code execution, materially wrong billing/financial behavior, unsafe hardware access, or silently invalid scientific/model results that would be promoted or published.
- **Warning:** a reproducible correctness, validation, compatibility, concurrency, security, performance, accessibility, or observability defect with a reachable changed-code path.
- **Suggestion:** a bounded maintainability improvement that meaningfully reduces future defect risk but does not indicate the current change is wrong.
- Do not flag formatting-only differences already owned by tooling, personal style preferences, generated-file churn without a concrete consequence, or speculative performance concerns without identifying a hot path and mechanism.
- Do not duplicate one root cause across multiple comments. Prefer the highest-signal location and explain the affected behavior.

## Verification expectations

- New or changed behavior needs a focused test that asserts the observable result and at least one material failure or edge case.
- Select verification from the repository's checked-in scripts, CI configuration, and manifests. Do not invent a command solely because it is conventional for the language.
- Dependency and lockfile changes require checking the resolved graph, provenance, compatibility, and known-vulnerability impact; lockfile regeneration alone is not evidence of safety.
- Changes to APIs, persistence, schemas, checkpoints, protocols, CLI output, or configuration need backward-compatibility or explicit migration coverage.
- For hardware, accelerator, external-service, or driver paths, require a live probe on the actual target when the claim depends on runtime behavior. Clearly distinguish tested, simulated, and inferred results.
- Missing tests are a finding when they leave changed behavior unverified, not as a blanket request for coverage on untouched code.

## Security, privacy, and performance

- Trace untrusted data from entry to use. Check validation, authorization, injection, traversal, unsafe deserialization, secret handling, log redaction, and denial-of-service/resource bounds.
- Never recommend committing secrets, credentials, tokens, private operational data, model access keys, production payloads, or raw user data.
- Performance findings must identify the workload, scale, allocation or synchronization mechanism, and why the changed path regresses it. Preserve correctness and matched work when comparing timings.
- Treat timeouts, retries, cancellation, cleanup, and partial failure as part of the public behavior for networked, concurrent, or long-running work.

## Sub-agent usage

- Use 0 sub-agents for docs-only, formatting-only, generated-lockfile-only, or single-file typo changes.
- Use 1-2 targeted sub-agents for a focused change that touches one risky boundary such as authentication, persistence, concurrency, accelerator code, model evaluation, or security-sensitive parsing.
- Use 3 targeted sub-agents when a change crosses independent domains; divide ownership by domain and include one verifier focused on tests and observable behavior.
- Use the full 6 only for genuinely large cross-cutting or security-critical changes. Do not ask every sub-agent to review the same files.
- Sub-agents remain read-only and return path, line, severity, mechanism, impact, verification evidence, and confidence. The main reviewer must validate findings and avoid duplicate comments.

## Review summary and comment style

- Lead with concrete findings ordered by severity. If there are none, say so plainly and name the verification gaps or residual risks that remain.
- Every inline finding must identify the changed-code path, the failure mechanism, the user/runtime impact, and a practical verification or fix direction.
- Be concise and evidence-led. Ask a question only when the answer can change whether the code is correct; do not use questions to disguise speculative findings.
- Separate confirmed defects from assumptions. Do not claim tests, hardware probes, deployments, migrations, or external checks ran unless the review evidence proves they did.
